## Marea AI Dapp
Marea AI is the leading DeFi (Decentralized Finance) terminal on Sui blockchain, powered by Artificial Intelligence. Users can swap tokens, view trending tokens, analyze their portfolio, stake SUI, and more, without any interrumptions and a seamless experience.

## What makes Marea AI unique
* **AI-Powered DeFi Execution.-** Easily perform DeFi actions like transferring assets, staking SUI, swapping tokens, and tracking trendsâ€”all through a chatbot. No complex UI, just seamless interactions. Some of the technologies we used were provided by protocols such as SpringSui, Navi, Atoma Network.
* **Google Sign-In (No Wallet Needed!).-** Users log in with Google OAuth, instantly generating a Sui address linked to their account. This removes wallet setup friction while keeping transactions secure via PostgreSQL storage.
* **Instant Transactions, Zero Hassle.-** Forget manual transaction signingâ€”just enter your order, and the blockchain executes it. Faster, simpler, and more intuitive than traditional DeFi interactions.
* **Integrated with Top Sui Protocols.-** Built for the Sui ecosystem, Marea AI connects with Cetus for trading and SpringSui for liquidity, ensuring smooth, efficient transactions without switching platforms.

## Future Work
Marea AI is just getting started! We have ambitious plans to expand its capabilities and improve the user experience:
* **zkLogin**.- Implement zkLogin for an easier and safer access to all users.
* **AI + NFTs Integration**.- Enable users to buy, sell, sweep, and create NFTs directly through AI commands.
* **Expanded DeFi Protocol Support**.- Integrate with more Sui DeFi protocols, providing deeper liquidity, advanced trading strategies, and additional staking options.
* **Optimized Mobile Experience**.- Enhance the UI/UX for mobile users, ensuring a smoother, more intuitive interface for DeFi interactions on the go.
*  **Multi-Chain Expansion**.- Expand beyond Sui to support cross-chain transactions, making it easier for users from other ecosystems to bridge and onboard to Sui ecosystem.
